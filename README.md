This Learning log app was made using Django. This app that allows the user to keep a journal of topics of interest and create journal entries as they explore each topic. After a successful login, the user is able to create new topics, add new posts, read and edit existing posts.
Even its status is production, this app has only an educational purpose, so please do not share any personal information while using it.

Note: if the page takes a few seconds to response, it is normal, since I am using the free version of Heroku. Data loss may be a consequence of it too.
